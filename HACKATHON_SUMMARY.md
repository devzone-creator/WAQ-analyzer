## 📝 Executive Summary

The WikiIndaba Quality Analyzer is a comprehensive, multi-language tool designed to analyze Wikipedia articles with a special focus on African content representation. Built specifically for the WikiIndaba Hackathon 2025, this tool addresses the critical need for improving African language, culture, and knowledge representation within the Wikimedia ecosystem.

### Problem Statement

African content on Wikipedia faces several challenges:
- **Language Gap:** Significant quality differences between English, French, and Arabic editions
- **Source Bias:** Over-reliance on Western sources, under-representation of African institutions
- **Cultural Context:** Lack of local perspectives and cultural sensitivity
- **Content Gaps:** Missing or incomplete articles about African topics

### Our Solution

A powerful analysis tool that:
1. **Analyzes quality** across 8 languages (EN, FR, AR, SW, HA, YO, AM, ZU)
2. **Tracks African content** representation with specialized metrics
3. **Compares articles** across language editions to identify gaps
4. **Provides actionable recommendations** for improvement
5. **Exports results** for community collaboration
